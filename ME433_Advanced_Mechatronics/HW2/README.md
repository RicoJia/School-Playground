### Description
This project uses PIC32-170F256B and MCP4922 generate a 2Hz sine wave and a 1Hz triangle wave. Both should range from 0V to 3.3V. The update rate of the DAC should be at least 50 times faster than the frequency of the signal you are producing.

SPI is the communication protocol between the two components.
