# Turtlesim Trajectory Control in Roscpp 

This project is an educational project where I became familiar with visualization using rviz.

At the current stage of development, an Rviz Xacro model is implemented for turtlebot burger 3. The model is solely a visualization, collision and inertial properties are being considered here.
